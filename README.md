Designed and built a 6-V lead-acid battery charger based on a discrete series pass linear regulator with Zener reference and voltage-feedback control.

This project involved full LTSpice simulation, component sizing, PCB design, and hardware testing.

🔧 Key features:
• Zener reference voltage system  
• BJT error amplifier  
• Linear pass transistor with heatsink  
• Load testing (5–20 Ω)  
• Battery charging verification  
• Custom PCB + 3D model
